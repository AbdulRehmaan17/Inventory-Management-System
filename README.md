1.	Introduction 
The project is about Inventory Management System. The goal of our project is to create a reliable Inventory management system (WMS) that will simplify inventory control and Inventory operations. This application's goal is to provide a complete digital solution to address the issues with conventional Inventory management techniques. The WMS seeks to maximize order processing, Inventory operations, and inventory control in order to raise productivity, accuracy, and efficiency levels. The solution improves inventory visibility, lowers stockouts and overstocking, minimizes fulfillment failures, and ultimately boosts the efficiency of Inventory operations by centralizing inventory data, automating procedures, and offering real-time insights.
